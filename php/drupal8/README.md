# Drupal 8 CI config files and scripts

This folder contains the Drupal 8 configuration. This folder is intended for
generic Drupal 8 sites, modules and themes.

You should copy the following files to your own repository.

* .codeclimate.yml

## Important

By default, Drupal 8 has a .eslintrc.json in the web directory that is committed
with the code. You have to delete and ignore that file for eslint validation
with CodeClimate to work!
